HOW TO CREATE NEW USER IN ORACLE USING SQL DEV TOOLS
---------------------------------------------------

1) Make a new connection with user 'system'
2) Open worksheet in that connection.


-----------------------

Run: alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;


Run: 

CREATE USER Elsewedy_DB IDENTIFIED BY mypassword
  DEFAULT TABLESPACE users
  TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
  QUOTA UNLIMITED ON users;



Run:

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO Elsewedy_DB;


Run:

ALTER USER Elsewedy_DB ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

---------------------------------------------

Now that user has been created. Make a new connection with the same username, and password above (it was 'mypassword'). 
Normal steps of making a connection (skip if uk):
name -> anything
username -> Elsewedy_DB (or whatever u picked in the code u ran above)
password -> mypassword (or whatever u picked in the code u ran above)
SID -> (it's either 'xe' or 'orcl')
